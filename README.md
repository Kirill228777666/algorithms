# Interesting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of some fundamental and fascinating algorithms in programming. Each algorithm is implemented with detailed explanations and comments to enhance understanding.

## Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Euclidean Algorithm
- Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers efficiently.
- Uses an iterative approach with modulo operations.

### 2. Segment Tree
- A data structure for efficient range queries (such as GCD on a subarray).
- Supports both query and update operations in logarithmic time.

### 3. Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Used in decision-making for two-player games.
- Efficient pruning technique reduces the number of evaluated nodes.
- Improves performance compared to the standard Minimax algorithm.

### 4. Miller-Rabin Primality Test
- A probabilistic algorithm to check if a number is prime.
- Uses modular exponentiation and randomized base selection.
- Number of iterations affects the accuracy of the test.

### 5. Dynamic programming
- A common and effective algorithm for solving problems by breaking them down into subtasks
- The initial data (DP base) and the recursive ratio are set, and the calculation is performed in a loop.
